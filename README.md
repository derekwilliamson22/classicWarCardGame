Game logic for the classic card game "War" built in Javascript over the weekend.

Fork and Clone the repo or Copy/Paste the code to add to your sandbox of choice.

I wanted to challenge myself by brushing up on my Javascript skills by trying to create the game from scratch.

I definitely searched for answers to my questions and used online documentation, mostly from MDN, to remind myself of certain methods.

It is far from perfect, but I'm proud I made it this far!
